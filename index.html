    <h3 style="text-align:center;">
      sFT, or Swipe File Transfer, is a CIA and 3DSX file downloader for any hacked 2DS/3DS with FBI. It works by using FBI's direct URL download feature to send Homebrew from this website to your 3DS, so it is essentially a custom version of something like Google Drive or MEGA, just not with an upload feature (yet :D).
