      What is sFT and how does it work?
    </h2>
    <h4 style="text-align:center;">
      sFT, or Swipe File Transfer, is a CIA and 3DSX file downloader for any hacked 2DS/3DS with FBI. It works by using FBI's direct URL download feature to send Homebrew from this website to your 3DS, so it is essentially a custom version of something like Google Drive or MEGA, just not with an upload feature (yet :D).

      So... I want to download something. How would I do it?
    </h2>
    <h4 style="text-align:center;">
      First you would open FBI and navigate to Remote Install -> Manually Enter URLs. Next, enter in a URL in the format of nanobot567.github.io/sFT/dl/(filename).cia/.3dsx. Wait for the file to finish downloading, and you're done!
