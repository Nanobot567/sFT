# sFT - Swipe File Transfer
---

## What's sFT?
sFT is an incomplete file sharing service made for any hacked 2DS/3DS which has FBI installed, or any other homebrew program which allows for direct URL downloads.

## How will it work?
It will work like other file sharing services online such as Dropbox or MEGA; you upload a file, it gets sent to the server, and voila! There's your file.

## What are your plans?
I plan to add a personal directory for my own files, and a public directory with different vanity URL names. A half-functional website would be great too :D.

## When do you think it will be finished?

Never sounds like a reasonable deadline.

### UPDATE:

Since I am cheap, I will upload a few CIAs and 3DSXs for download instead of buying a server for php uploads. Below is the list of files I have added (filename/whatisthis/cia?/3dsx?)

* anemone / Anemone3DS - Theme Manager / Yes / Yes (so you could do either nanobot567.github.io/sFT/dl/anemone.3dsx or nanobot567.github.io/sFT/dl/anemone.cia in FBI)
